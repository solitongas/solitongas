<p>Integral equations play important role in mathematical physics. In this short note, we are going to discuss a class of integral equation of the first kind. My motivation to study those equations is from soliton gas, where the nonlinear dispersion relation is as follows:
$$\int_\Gamma g(z,w)u(w)|dw|+\sigma(z)u(z)=\phi(z),\quad z\in \Gamma$$</p>
<p>where <code>$\Gamma$</code> is some simple smooth rectifiable curve in <code>$\mathbb{C}^+$</code> and kernel <code>$g(z,w)=\log\left|\frac{z-\bar w}{z-w}\right|$</code> is so-called Green kernel (i.e. it is the Green function to the Direchlet problem on the upper half plane.). The case when <code>$\sigma\equiv 0$</code> is referred to as soliton condensate. As one can immediately see, the equation becomes Fredholm equation of the first kind. It is well-known that integral equation of the first kind is (in general) ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Here we are going to consider a slightly different equation:
$$\int_{\Gamma}\log|w-z|^{-1} u(w)|dw|=f(z),\quad z\in \Gamma.$$</p>
<p>And we will consider the uniqueness of the equation using classical potential theory. Then we will use a method introduced by Yan&amp;Sloan to solve the equation explicitly.</p>
<h1 id="potential-theory-and-uniqueness">Potential theory and uniqueness</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first introduce some definitions from classical complex analysis. All the definitions and theorems can be found on Hille&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1.</strong>  Let <code>$\mu$</code> be a probability measure supported in <code>$\Gamma$</code> (i.e. <code>$\mu(\Gamma)=1$</code>.), the <strong>logarithmic potential</strong> is
$$U^{\mu}(z)=-\int_\Gamma \log\left|z-w\right|d\mu(w),\quad z\in \mathbb{C}.$$</p>
<p><strong>Definition 2.</strong> The <strong>energy</strong> is defined as
$$I(\mu)=\int U^{\mu}(z) d\mu(z).$$</p>
<p><strong>Definition 3.</strong> The <strong>capacity</strong> of a compact set <code>$\Gamma$</code> is defined as
$$C_\Gamma=e^{-V_\Gamma}=\exp{(-\inf_{\mu\in M(\Gamma)}I(\mu))},$$ where <code>$V_\Gamma$</code> is so-called <strong>Robin constant</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 4.</strong> A <strong>charge</strong> is a signed measure, which always has the decomposition as <code>$\sigma=\sigma_+-\sigma_-$</code>, where <code>$\sigma_\pm$</code> are called positive and negative part of the charge. And we denote the space of charge with finite energy as <code>$S(\Gamma)$</code>.</p>
