title: About Me
author: Fudong Wang

Hi, my dear friend (yes, itâ€™s you!), welcome to my blog. This is your truly, Fudong Wang, whom currently works as a postdoc at UCF (supervised by **Alexander Tovbis**). My dissertation advisor is **Wen-Xiu Ma**. My research interests include classical soliton theory ( inverse scattering, long-time asymptotics) and (currently) spectral theory of **[soliton/breather gases](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Soliton_gas)**. Besides integrable system, I am also interested in complex analysis related problem, such as classic potential theory, **[free boundary problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_boundary_problem)** and uniform algebra.
