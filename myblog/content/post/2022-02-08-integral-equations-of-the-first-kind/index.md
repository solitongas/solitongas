Integral equations play important role in mathematical physics. In this short note, we are going to discuss a class of integral equation of the first kind. My motivation to study those equations is from soliton gas, where the nonlinear dispersion relation is as follows:
`$$\int_\Gamma g(z,w)u(w)|dw|+\sigma(z)u(z)=\phi(z),\quad z\in \Gamma,$$`
where `$\Gamma$` is some simple smooth rectifiable curve in `$\mathbb{C}^+$`. The case when `$\sigma\equiv 0$` is referred to as soliton condensate. As one can immediately see, the equation becomes Fredholm equation of the first kind. It is well-known that integral equation of the first kind is ill-posed in the sense of Hadamarda.
