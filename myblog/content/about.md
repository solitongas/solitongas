Hi, my dear friend (yes, itâ€™s you!), welcome to my blog. This is your truly, Fudong Wang, currently work as a postdoc at UCF. My research interests include classical soliton theory ( inverse scattering, long-time asymptotics) and (currently) spectral theory of soliton/breather gases. Besides integrable system, I am also interested in complex analysis related problem, such as classic potential theory, free boundary problem and uniform algebra.
