      <description>Integral equations play important role in mathematical physics. In this short note, we are going to discuss a class of integral equation of the first kind. My motivation to study those equations is from soliton gas, where the nonlinear dispersion relation is as follows: $$\int_\Gamma g(z,w)u(w)|dw|+\sigma(z)u(z)=\phi(z),\quad z\in \Gamma,$$ where $\Gamma$ is some simple smooth rectifiable curve in $\mathbb{C}^+$. The case when $\sigma\equiv 0$ is referred to as soliton condensate. As one can immediately see, the equation becomes Fredholm equation of the first kind.</description>

      <description>Hi, my dear friend (yes, it&amp;rsquo;s you!), welcome to my blog. This is your truly, Fudong Wang, currently work as a postdoc at UCF. My research interests include classical soliton theory ( inverse scattering, long-time asymptotics) and (currently) spectral theory of soliton/breather gases. Besides integrable system, I am also interested in complex analysis related problem, such as classic potential theory, free boundary problem and uniform algebra.</description>
