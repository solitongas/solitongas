      <description>Background Integral equations play important role in mathematical physics. In this short note, we are going to discuss a class of integral equation of the first kind. My motivation to study those equations is from soliton gas, where the nonlinear dispersion relation is as follows: $$\int_\Gamma g(z,w)u(w)|dw|+\sigma(z)u(z)=\phi(z),\quad z\in \Gamma$$
where $\Gamma$ is some simple smooth rectifiable curve in $\mathbb{C}^+$ and kernel $g(z,w)=\log\left|\frac{z-\bar w}{z-w}\right|$ is so-called Green kernel (i.e. it is the Green function to the Direchlet problem on the upper half plane.</description>

      <description>Hi, my dear friend (yes, itâ€™s you!), welcome to my blog. This is your truly, Fudong Wang, currently work as a postdoc at UCF. My research interests include classical soliton theory ( inverse scattering, long-time asymptotics) and (currently) spectral theory of soliton/breather gases. Besides integrable system, I am also interested in complex analysis related problem, such as classic potential theory, free boundary problem and uniform algebra.</description>
